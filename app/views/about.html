<div class="jumbotron">
	<p>Message&copy; is a complete copy of <a id='ba-link' href='http://bigassmessage.com/'>BigAssMessage.com<a/> and it lacks of almost all the options it has to offer. If you really want to make a badass bigassmessage visit the original site.
This site was only created to test Angular.js because im learning it.
